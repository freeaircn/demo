1 更改base url:
  【前端】config/prod.env.js，更改BASE_API地址
    module.exports = {
    NODE_ENV: '"production"',
    BASE_API: '"http://127.0.0.1"',
  }

  【后端】application\config\config.php，更改$config['base_url']地址
  |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  |
  | URL to your CodeIgniter root. Typically this will be your base URL,
  | WITH a trailing slash:
  |
  |	http://example.com/
  |
  | WARNING: You MUST set this value!
  |
  | If it is not set, then CodeIgniter will try guess the protocol and path
  | your installation, but due to security concerns the hostname will be set
  | to $_SERVER['SERVER_ADDR'] if available, or localhost otherwise.
  | The auto-detection mechanism exists only for convenience during
  | development and MUST NOT be used in production!
  |
  | If you need to allow multiple domains, remember that this file is still
  | a PHP script and you can easily do that on your own.
